# Design-Patterns
I have implemented 15 design patterns in Java, all centered around the exploration of operating systems, including their types and components.
For all the 15 design patterns these things are there:
1) Code
2) UML Diagram
3) Pdf file which consists of theory and implementaion for each pattern.
